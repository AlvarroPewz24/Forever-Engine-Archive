  <h1 align="center">Friday Night Funkin': Forever Engine [ARCHIVE]</h1>
</p>

-----------------------------------------------------
Due to recent events, [Yoshubs / CubicYoshi](https://github.com/Yoshubs)'s github account has been deleted

in order to preserve her hard work on this project, [I, Gabriela](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi) have archived the files for all versions of Forever Engine I had saved on separate repositories.

This repository contains both [Forever Engine Legacy](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine/tree/legacy) and the unfinished [Forever Engine 1.0, a full rewrite of FNF **and** Forever as a whole](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine/tree/rewrite)

the current [master](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine) branch contains a Hybrid between the two versions, the Rewrite, and Legacy

**thank you for your effort Cubii, and stay safe.**

~ **Sincerely, BeastlyGhost**
